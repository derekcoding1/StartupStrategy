# Prediction
## Goal
Once we get the strategy score, we are able to build inference models to test the correlation between our proposed strategy score (independent variable) and startups performance indicators (dependent variables), which therefore allows us to evaluate our strategy score.

## To-do list

- Explore the startups database to find suitable dependent variables and prepare the data for model building.
- Create a linear regression model between strategy score and previous dependent variables, including Equity Growth (IPO or Acquisition) and Seed Funding.
- Add fixed-effect variables to eliminate the influence of possible confounding factors.
